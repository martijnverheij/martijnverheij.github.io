# Are you chatting more?

E-mail is still the number ons way of quick communication with each other. Everyone understands it, and use it.

What I personally hate are the emails with one ore 2 lines of text and the haven’t any simple greeting. 

My first thing I think about this behavior is “why we have this conversation in in email?” 

## In this blog I will explain more.
